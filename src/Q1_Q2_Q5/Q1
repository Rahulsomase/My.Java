                      Synchronized Method                                                                   Synchronized block
1. in case of sync method, a thread can access only either object level         1 in case of synch block, a thread can access to the synch area either by taking that 
   lock or class level lock of that class only.                                   class level lock,that class object level lock or any other class level lock or object
                                                                                   level lock also. (any type of lock.)

 2.with the help of synch method one thread can enter into the that area         2 whereas with synch block a thread can enter into the sycnh area by acquiring multiple 
    only after getting one lock.                                                                              locks simulteniosly.

3. Synchronized method acquires a lock on the whole object. This means no         3 Synchronized blocks acquire a lock in object between parentheses after the synchronized keyword.
    other thread can use any synchronized method in the whole object while          Meaning no other thread can acquire a lock on the locked object until the  
    the method is being run by one thread.                                         synchronized block exits.

4  A synchronized method uses the method receiver as a lock, ‘this’ for non      4 Synchronized blocks use the expression as a lock.

5 Synchronized method always locks either on current object represented by      5 Synchronized method always locks either on current object represented by class level lock,   
    class level lock, if its static synchronized method.                            if its static synchronized method any lock to provide mutual exclusion to critical section code.

6 In case of synchronized method, lock is acquired by thread when it enter      6 In case of synchronized block, thread acquires lock when they enter synchronized block and 
   method and released when it leaves method, either normally or by throwing         released when they leave synchronized block.

7 For synchronized methods, the lock will be held throughout the method scope.  7 In the synchronized block, the lock is held only during that block scope also referred to as 
                                                                                  critical section.      
                                                                                  
8 In the synchronized block, the lock is held only during that block scope      8 A synchronized block inside a static method will acquire a lock in the object between parentheses.  
   also referred to as critical section.
