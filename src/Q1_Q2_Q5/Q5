Q5/- What is the Difference between the sleep and join method .
Ans:-
           Sleep                                                                    Join
Sleep is from Suspending a thread based on time                 Join is from Suspending a thread conditionally
 
 Thread.sleep(1000); here 1000 is in milisec.                   Thread.join();
 
 Sleep will stop for the argument passed sec                    Passed thread will execute first.   
 
 This method will suspend the current thread which              If a thread t1 calls join() method on another thread t2, like
    is under execution with those many millisecond              t2.join() then t1 thread will be enter into waiting state
    passed as  argument(1000ms=1sec).                           until t2 thread completes.

   It is  static method                                         It is non static method
