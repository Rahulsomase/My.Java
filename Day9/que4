1 Overriding:
  Same method signature in both superclass & child class
  In overriding riding we can change the data of parent fun using overriding> We have to create same maethod as present inside
  parent class.
  ex:
  class Parent {
  void eat(){
  sout("I am eating")
  }
  class child{
  @overriding
  // here we are using same mtd of parent
  void eat(){
  sout("child eat")
  }
  }


2 Overloading
Same method name but different parameters in same class

ex:
class Parent{

void eat(){
sout("I am eating");
}
void eat (String par){
sout("I am eating"+par)
}

}
