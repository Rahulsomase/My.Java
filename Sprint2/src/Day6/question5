Q5/- What is the Difference between the sleep and join method .
Ans:-


sleep:
1) It belongs to the ‘Thread’ class.
2) It doesn’t release the lock on the object when synchronization is in process.
3) It is a static method.
4) From a synchronized context, there is no need to call the ‘sleep’ method.
5) This method has three overloaded methods, they are −
6) sleep(long millis)millis: milliseconds
7) sleep(long millis,int nanos) nanos: Nanoseconds



Join:
1) join() method, on the other hand, is also defined in java.lang package but in Thread class.
2) join() is used for adding sequencing between multiple threads, one thread starts execution after first thread execution finished.
3) we can not break the waiting imposed by join() method without unless or interruption the thread on which join is called has execution finished.
4) no such condition required for calling join() method and we can call join() method with and without synchronized context in Java..
5) calling join() method doesn't release any monitor or lock.
