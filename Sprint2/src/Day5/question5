Q5) Differentiate between the Thread class and Runnable interface for creating a
Thread? 
ANS:-


thread class
1)	Each thread creates a unique object and gets associated with it.
2) 	As each thread create a unique object, more memory required.
3) In Java, multiple inheritance not allowed hence, after a class extends Thread class, it can not extend any other class.
4) A user must extend thread class only if it wants to override the other methods in Thread class.
5) 	Extending Thread class introduces tight coupling as the class contains code of Thread class and also the job assigned to the thread


Runnable interface:-
1) Multiple threads share the same objects.
2) As multiple threads share the same object less memory is used.) 
3) If a class define thread implementing the Runnable interface it has a chance of extending one class.
4)  If you only want to specialize run method then implementing Runnable is a better option.
5) Implementing Runnable interface introduces loose coupling as the code of Thread is separate form the job of Threads.
