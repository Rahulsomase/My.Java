Q3) Explain the difference between equals() and HashCode() Method.

equals() :-
1. equals is a method in Java that acts similar to the == operator, which is to test for object
identity rather than object equality.
2. The method equals is used to compare two objects.
3. Object class equals() method implementation returns true only when both the references are pointing to same object.

hashCode() :-
1. hashCode is a method by which a class implicitly or explicitly break down the data stored in an
instance of the class into a single hash value.
2. The method is used in hashing to decide which group an object should be placed into.
3. If two objects are unequal according to equals() method, their hash code are not required to be different.
 Their hash code value may or may-not be equal.
