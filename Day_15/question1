Q-1. Explain the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList


ArrayList
1. ArrayList internally uses a dynamic array to store its elements.
2. ArrayList is slow as array manipulation is slower.
3. ArrayList implements only List.
4. ArrayList is faster in storing and accessing data.


LinkedList
1. LinkedList uses Doubly Linked List to store its elements.
2. LinkedList is faster being node based as not much bit shifting required.
3. LinkedList implements List as well as Queue. It can acts as a queue as well.
4. LinkedList is faster in manipulation of data.

Example of ArrayList vs LinkedList

import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.List;
public class JavaTester {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
      List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
      list.add("A");
      list.add("B");
      list.add("C");
      list.add("D");
      List<String> list1 = new LinkedList<>();
      list1.add("A");
      list1.add("B");
      list1.add("C");
      list1.add("D");
      System.out.println(list);
      System.out.println(list1);
   }
}

//Output
  [A, B, C, D]
  [A, B, C, D]
